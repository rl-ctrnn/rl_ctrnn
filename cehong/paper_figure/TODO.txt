1. generate data for 100 runs of networks of size 2-10 (DONE)
2. plot a visualization aggregating all of them together       (DONE)

These two alone would probably suffice in addition to a single plot on one network size 10 that is trained to perform very well.

3. Generate comparison data from HC

This would be training the HC using mutations of BOTH the weights AND the biases!

The other thing that would be a great comparison (optional for this paper) would be to 
generate data for hill climbers in the same fashion as a point of comparison
the data for the HC might need to have the measure of the Beer's fitness to be meaningfully similar
since the RL would have been running for a while to remove transients.

4. Plot the aggregated data for the RL in comparison to the HC
probably needs to have a different view, possibly just showing the scores at a few locations

It would be OK to do the same with RW, but I suspect HC alone would be the most useful/meaningful


5. Try some different visualizations, possibly using violin or boxplots at different timesteps (i.e. every 1000 steps)
to more easily compare te different sizes
